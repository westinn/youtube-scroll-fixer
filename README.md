# youtube-scroll-fixer
Chrome extension to fix YouTube's sticky top search bar.

YouTube has this really annoying search bar that sticks to the top of your browser, no matter how you scroll or adjust. For a video site, this is insane since it blocks the video when you try to resize the window. It will literally push the video out of the viewfinder to make room.

This removes the "stickyness" of the search bar and renders it like any other element on a page.
